  1. If itâ€™s a hack, it goes in shame.css.
  2. Document all hacks fully:
    a. What part of the codebase does it relate to?
    b. Why was this needed?
    c. How does this fix it?
    d. How might you fix it properly, given more time?
  3. Do not blame the developer; if they explained why they had to do it then their reasons are probably (hopefully) valid.
  4. Try and clean shame.css up when you have some down time.
    a. Even better, get a tech-debt story in which you can dedicate actual sprint time to it.

/* 
  This targets the menu icons in the sidebar, and `inline` is needed to stop it from being overridden by something else. 

  This was brought about when I implemented styling for <a> tags that included an animation that leveraged the ::before pseudo-element.
  The menu uses the ::before pseudo-element to display the icon, and was getting caught in the cross-fire, making one ugly dog's breakfast.
  I've fixed 80% of the problems arising from that, but the display issue remains.
  Without the inline being !important, it inherits `block` and looks bad. 
  This overrides that, and is one of the few times that I have needed to use important. Let's keep it that way in future.
